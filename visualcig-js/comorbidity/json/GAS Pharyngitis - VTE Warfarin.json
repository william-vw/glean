we suggest warfarin is the preferred oral anticoagulant. \r\nHowever, the requirement for routine INR monitoring of warfarin may be less than ideal for patients with restricted mobility, poor venous access, or other barriers to successful INR monitoring unless they are suitable candidates for self-testing at home using point-of-care INR monitoring devices (see below).\r\n\r\nWhen avoiding drugs
