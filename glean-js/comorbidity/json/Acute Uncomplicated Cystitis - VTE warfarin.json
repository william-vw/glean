For VTE treatment in breastfeeding mothers we suggest that warfarin therapy is the best oral anticoagulant option.\nFor patients with CrCl < 30 mL\/min (estimated using the Cockroft-Gault equation) we suggest warfarin is the preferred anticoagulant. We also suggest vigilant monitoring including more frequent INR testing and bleeding risk assessment in patients withCrCl < 30 mL\/min.\n\nFor patients with a history of poor medication adherence we suggest warfarin is the preferred oral anticoagulant. \nHowever, the requirement for routine INR monitoring of warfarin may be less than ideal for patients with restricted mobility, poor venous access, or other barriers to successful INR monitoring unless they are suitable candidates for self-testing at home using point-of-care INR monitoring devices (see below).\n\nWhen avoiding drugs known to interact with a given anticoagulant is not an option, we suggest that warfarin is preferred because dose adjustments based on INR monitoring can facilitate titration of the anticoagulant response.","node_type": "decision_node","workflow_state": "completedState","decisional_state": "chosenState","children": [{"name": "VTE warfarin treatment","description": "During warfarin initiation
